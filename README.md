## This probably won't do much

I spent too long trying to figure out local host and Google that I didn't have time to code anything. I didn't know enough about localhost to understand how it worked. I hadn't even realized that it was a keyword, I thought it was just jargon or a bizzword. I have been trying to develope on a virtual machine and test on the actual machine. I never realized until just now that I could test my website from the same machine and environment that was deploying the server.

## I'm Sorry
This has not been a good term for me.
